# 📊 Unemployment Analysis in India using Python   

Unemployment is a crucial economic indicator that reflects the health of a country’s labor market. This project analyzes unemployment trends in India using **Python** and data visualization techniques. By examining real-world labor data, we uncover patterns in employment rates, labor participation, and the differences between rural and urban employment.  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project involves:  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting date columns.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends in unemployment rates across different states and time periods.  
✅ **Visualizations** – Creating insightful charts to compare **state-wise unemployment rates**, **rural vs. urban employment trends**, and **labor force participation rates**.  
✅ **Statistical Insights** – Understanding workforce patterns using descriptive statistics.  

## 📌 Technologies Used  
🔹 **Python** (Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation)  
🔹 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for stunning visualizations)  
🔹 **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive analysis)  

## 📊 Dataset Details  
The dataset contains:  
- **Region** – State/territory in India  
- **Date** – Time of data collection  
- **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)** – Percentage of unemployed individuals  
- **Estimated Employed** – Number of employed people  
- **Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)** – Percentage of working-age people participating in the labor market  
- **Area Type** – Whether the data is from a **Rural** or **Urban** area  

## 🚀 Why This Project?  
Understanding employment trends helps policymakers, economists, and businesses make informed decisions. This analysis provides valuable insights into the **impact of economic changes on employment** and how different states and regions are affected.
